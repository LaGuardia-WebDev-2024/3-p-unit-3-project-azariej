      rice. <br />
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Using a bamboo rolling mat, roll up from the
      bottom, tightly away from you (a). Leave a small amount of nori unrolled
      (b). Wet this part of the nori with water and finish rolling to seal it.

    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat
      <br />
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8
      minutes. Use a wooden spoon to break the meat into smaller crumbles as the
      meat cooks. <br />
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the onions and cook, stirring every once in a
      while, until softened, about 5 minutes. <br />
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Using a bamboo rolling mqerbat, roll up from the
      bottom, tightly away from you (a). Leave a small amount of nori unrolled
      (b). Wet this part of the nori with water and finish rolling to seal it.
      Then cut <br />
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and
      red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.
      <br />
      <strong>Step 6:</strong> Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to
      scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. <br />
      <strong>Step 7:</strong> Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a
      generous pinch of black pepper. <br />
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook uncovered
      for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you
      can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for seasoning
      suggestions). <br />
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> About 15 minutes before the spaghetti sauce
      finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Then, cook
      the pasta according to the package directions, but check for doneness a
      minute or two before the suggested cooking time. <br />
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the
      basil. Toss in the cooked pasta and leave for a minute so that it absorbs
      some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with grated parmesan cheese
      on top. <br />
